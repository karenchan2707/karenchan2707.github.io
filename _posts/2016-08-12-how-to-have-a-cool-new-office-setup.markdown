title: How to have a cool new office setup
layout: post
---
Last week, my friend said, “I probably have the coolest new office setup in the world!” 

I realized by best new office setup she meant the equipment.
Her ‘coolest new office setup’ includes the IT infrastructure from Fuji Xerox, 
a ICT partner providing leading Document and Communication Services

I thought she was talking the working environment, but in Hong Kong, the environment is just impossible to be the best, right?

A lot of new office setup is done by Fuji Xerox.

Seems like it’s time for me to have one!
